        <div class="about-section">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Hello and welcome! I'm [Your Name], an Egyptian native with a deep passion for languages, cultures, and the art of translation. Growing up in Egypt, I've always been surrounded by the rich tapestry of Arabic culture and literature, which sparked my interest in languages from a young age. This passion led me on a journey to become a translator, bridging the gap between Arabic and English and helping people communicate across borders.</p>

Additionally, I volunteered as a translator for TEDx Talks, completing 26 talks and reviewing 8 talks, which gave me valuable experience in subtitling and content localization.</p>
            <p>I am proud to hold a Certification of volunteer activity and have received recommendations from professional platforms like TWP, further validating my skills and dedication to the field of translation.</p>
